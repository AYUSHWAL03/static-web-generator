## Overview
Static website generator is an innovative website generator that empowers users to effortlessly create their own websites by engaging in an interactive conversation. By leveraging ChatGPT, our project provides a natural language interface, allowing users to describe the components and features they want for their website. The generator then translates these prompts into HTML and CSS code, delivering a fully customized website tailored to the user's specifications.

## Key Features
- **Interactive Chat Interface:** Users can interact with ChatGPT through a chat-based interface to specify their website requirements, including components, styles, and layouts.

- **Component Library:** ChatWebsiteGen features a diverse library of components that users can seamlessly integrate into their websites. From navigation bars to image sliders, the generator supports a wide range of components.

- **Real-time Preview:** Users receive a real-time preview of their website as they provide prompts. This allows for instant feedback and adjustments during the creation process.

- **Downloadable Code:** Once the website is created, users can download the generated HTML and CSS code, providing them with a ready-to-use website structure.

- **Responsive Design:** The generated websites are designed to be responsive, ensuring a consistent and user-friendly experience across various devices.
